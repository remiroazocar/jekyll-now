<p align="justify">I have just returned from Albacete, Spain, where I took part in the <a href="http://www.aes.es/jornadas/en/">Spanish Health Economics Association (AES) Conference</a>, based in the <a href="https://www.uclm.es/">University of Castilla-La Mancha</a>. I talked about one of the projects I have been working on during the first few months of my PhD: predictive-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC). [Here](https://remiroazocar.github.io/jornadas_presentation_final.pdf). </p>

<p align="justify">Predictive adjusted indirect comparison (working name) is a novel formulation proposed by myself and my PhD supervisors, <a href="http://statistica.it/gianluca/">Gianluca Baio</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annaheathstats/">Anna Heath</a>, for population-adjusted indirect comparisons. Population-adjusted indirect comparison methods are increasingly used to compare treatment outcomes across separate clinical trials and to inform health technology assessment. They are used when the following situation is encountered:</p>

1. No head-to-head trials have been conducted between the treatments of interest
2. Individual-level data are available for an intervention, e.g. through the company's own trial, but unavailable for the other
3. There are cross-trial differences in patients' baseline characteristics

<p align="justify">The rationale behind PAIC is the following: Individual-level data for one trial are used to model the link between an outcome and the available prognostic variables and effect modifiers via a generalised linear model. Then, a large number of pseudo-populations are generated by forward sampling from the published aggregate-level values. The outcomes for a trial conducted in a population exchangeable with that of the trial with aggregate-level data are predicted. The simulated datasets are used to estimate an unbiased average treatment effect.</p>

Population-adjusted indirect comparison methods are increasingly used to compare treatment outcomes across separate clinical trials and to inform health technology assessment. A novel method for population-adjusted comparisons, predictive-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC), is presented and a comprehensive simulation study is carried out.

Received some useful feedback. 

Stay tuned for the pre-print.
