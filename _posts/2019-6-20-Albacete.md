title: talk at Jornadas AES

<p align="justify">I have just returned from Albacete, Spain, where I took part in the <a href="http://www.aes.es/jornadas/en/">Spanish Health Economics Association (AES) Conference</a>, based in the <a href="https://www.uclm.es/">University of Castilla-La Mancha</a>. I talked about one of the projects I have been working on during the first few months of my PhD: predictive-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC). <a href="https://remiroazocar.github.io/jornadas_presentation_final.pdf">Here</a> are the slides. 
  
<p align="justify">Predictive adjusted indirect comparison (working name) is a novel formulation proposed by myself and my PhD supervisors, <a href="http://statistica.it/gianluca/">Gianluca Baio</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annaheathstats/">Anna Heath</a>, for population-adjusted indirect comparisons. Population-adjusted indirect comparison methods are increasingly used to compare treatment outcomes across separate clinical trials when there are cross-trial differences in patients' baseline characteristics. Overall, the talk went pretty well and I received some very useful feedback. Stay tuned for the pre-print. </p>
