title: talk at ISPOR Europe

<p align="justify">I am in Copenhagen, where I am taking part in <a href="https://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/conferences/upcoming-conferences/ispor-europe-2019">ISPOR 
Europe 2019</a>. I am talking about predictive-adjusted indirect comparison 
(PAIC): a novel method for population-adjusted indirect
comparison. <a href="https://remiroazocar.github.io/ISPOR_paic_remiro.pdf">See here</a>. 
Â  
<p align="justify">Predictive-adjusted indirect comparison is a novel formulation proposed by myself and my PhD supervisors,
<a href="http://statistica.it/gianluca/">Gianluca Baio</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annaheathstats/">Anna Heath</a>, 
for population-adjusted indirect comparisons. Population-adjusted indirect comparison methods are increasingly used to compare treatment 
outcomes across separate clinical trials when there are cross-trial differences in patients' baseline characteristics. </p>
