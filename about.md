### Bio

<p align="justify">I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/">Department of Statistics, University College London</a>, where I work with <a href="http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/">Professor Gianluca Baio</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annaheathstats/">Professor Anna Heath</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/statistics-health-economics">Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation</a> research group. Prior to this, I completed master's degrees in <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/">Machine Learning</a> (2017) and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/research-degrees/financial-computing-mres-mphil-phd">Financial Computing</a> (2018) within the <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science, University College London</a>. I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a> (2016).</p>

### Research

<p align="justify">My research lies on the interface between statistics and health economics and outcomes research, involving both methodological and applied problems. More specifically, my primary research interest is the development of methodology to generalize or transport the results of randomized trials and observational studies to different target populations (in which no new studies can be performed). These methods are increasingly used to compare treatment outcomes across separate studies, with differences in patients' baseline characteristics. In health technology assessment, we must often overcome the additional burden of limited access to patient-level data. My current line of work also involves survival analysis and evidence synthesis methods to evaluate novel oncology drugs.</p>
  
<i>Interests: health technology assessment, causal inference, evidence synthesis, transportability/generalizability, biostatistics, survival analysis, indirect treatment comparisons, population adjustment, comparative effectiveness research.</i>

### Consultancy

<p align="justify">I am active as a consultant to the health care (both public and private) sector on statistical issues arising in health technology appraisal and evidence based medicine, predictive analytics, economic modelling and real-world evidence development. I have worked with contract research organisations such as <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a> and <a href="https://www.iconplc.com/">ICON plc</a>, where I have provided statistical support for submissions to HTA authorities and other clinical projects.</p>
