### Bio

<p align="justify">I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/">Department of Statistics, University College London</a>, where I work with <a href="http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/">Professor Gianluca Baio</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annaheathstats/">Professor Anna Heath</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/statistics-health-economics">Statistics for Health Economic Evaluation</a> research group. Prior to this, I completed master's degrees in <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/">Machine Learning</a> (2017) and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/research-degrees/financial-computing-mres-mphil-phd">Financial Computing</a> (2018) within the <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science, University College London</a>. I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a> (2016).</p>

### Research

<p align="justify">My research is on the interface between statistics and health economics and outcomes research. I am working on methodological and applied problems in indirect treatment comparison and survival analysis. More specifically, my current line of work involves the development of new methodologies for population adjustment with limited access to patient-level data. These methods are increasingly used to compare treatment outcomes across separate clinical trials when there are cross-trial differences in patients' baseline characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Interests: Biostatistics, survival analysis, indirect treatment comparison, population adjustment, Bayesian statistics, causal inference, health technology assessment, comparative effectiveness research.</i></p>

#### Talks and Presentations

* Predictive-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC): a novel method for population adjustment with limited access to patient-level data. <a href="https://remiroazocar.github.io/PAIC_ISPOR_EUROPE.pdf">Poster</a> presented at <a href="https://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/conferences/past-conferences/ispor-europe-2019">ISPOR Europe 2019</a> (Copenhagen). Related talk and conference paper presented at <a href="http://www.aes.es/Jornadas2019/es/">Jornadas AES 2019</a> (Castilla-La Mancha) and

### Consultancy

<p align="justify">I am active as a consultant to the health care sector on statistical issues arising in health technology appraisal and evidence based medicine, predictive analytics, economic modelling and real-world evidence development. I hold my own limited company but have also worked with contract research organisations such as <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a> and <a href="https://www.iconplc.com/">ICON plc</a>, where I have provided statistical support for submissions to HTA authorities and other clinical projects.</p>
